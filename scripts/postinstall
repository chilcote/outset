#  1. MacAdmins https://github.com/macadmins/python
#  2. Munki https://github.com/munki/munki
#  3. python.org https://www.python.org/downloads/
# If none of these are on disk, then fall back to Apple's system python,
# which can be installed via the Command Line Tools.

#  Outset does not support python 2, which was sunsetted on Jan 1, 2020.
#  See https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/.
#  If you choose to continue to use python 2, and you're running an OS older than macOS 12.3, 
#  you'll want to create the symlink via other means,
#  with something like: /bin/ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/local/outset/python3
