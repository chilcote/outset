outset
======

This script automatically processes packages and scripts at first boot and/or each (subsequent) user login. 

Requirements
------------
+ python 2.7  
+ I've only tested on 10.9+. YMMV
+ (and not explicitly required, but strongly recommended:)[The Luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage)

Usage
-----

The script is meant to be triggered by launchd so there is no interactive mode as such. The `--boot` argument is triggered by a LaunchDaemon and therefore will be run by root. The `--login` argument is triggered by a LaunchAgent, so it is running in the user context.  

For testing purposes, one could manually run the command from the same directory as the outset script:

	sudo ./outset --boot
	./outset --login

`outset` is controlled by five launchd plists:

	/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.outset.boot.plist
	/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.outset.cleanup.plist
	/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.outset.login.plist
	/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.outset.logout.plist
	/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.outset.on-demand.plist

The `com.github.outset.boot.plist` launch daemon runs any scripts and packages you'd like to have processed at first or every boot. You pass scripts and packages to the launchd job by placing them in the corresponding directories listed below. Scripts in the `boot-every` directory will run at each boot. Scripts/packages in `boot-once` directory will self-destruct after completion (this is for firstboot packages and configuration scripts that you only want to run once):

	/usr/local/outset/boot-once
	/usr/local/outset/boot-every

The `com.github.outset.login.plist` launch agent runs any scripts you wish to be processed at user login. You pass scripts and packages to the launchd job by placing them in the corresponding directories listed below. `Login-every` scripts will continue to be run at every login, while `login-once` scripts will only be run once per user:

	/usr/local/outset/login-once
	/usr/local/outset/login-every

The `com.github.outset.logout.plist` launch agent runs any scripts you wish to be processed at user logout. You pass scripts and packages to the launchd job by placing them in the corresponding directories listed below. `Logout-every` scripts will continue to be run at every login, while `logout-once` scripts will only be run once per user:

	/usr/local/outset/logout-once
	/usr/local/outset/logout-every

At logout, Outset will check to make sure there are, in fact, on users logged in before running anything. Keep in mind that any logout scripts you run will not have ~/ available as a user context, so if you want the last logged in user, you'll have to get the output of ``` defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow lastUserName ```

The `com.github.outset.on-demand.plist` launch agent runs any scripts you wish to be processed immediately, in the user context. You pass scripts and packages to the launchd job by placing them in the corresponding directory listed below, and then trigger the `on-demand` run by touching the file at `/private/tmp/.com.github.outset.ondemand.launchd`, i.e. with a postinstall script. `On-demand` scripts will be immediately removed by the `com.github.outset.cleanup.plist` launch daemon, so they will **not** run for subsequent logins:

	/usr/local/outset/on-demand

Logging
-------
`outset` logs to two different files, depending on the context in which the script is being run (root or user):

	/var/log/outset.log
	~/Library/Logs/outset.log

Note: Make sure all scripts you use in the controlled directories listed above have 'root' ownership, the group set to 'wheel', and permissions set to '755'. Packages should also have the ownership of 'root', and should have '644' permissions:

	sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/outset && chmod -R 755 /usr/local/outset/boot-every/*
	sudo chmod -R 644 /usr/local/outset/boot-every/*.pkg

Configuration
-------------
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/chilcote/outset/releases) or alternatively use [The Luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage) or your packaging tool of choice to install the script, accompanying launchd plists, and any items you want processed. You can use the resulting pkg installer in your [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG) workflow.

	sudo make pkg

You can also use The Luggage to package up some scripts to be run by `outset`. Here is an example Makefile that would package up some hypothetical scripts and packages to be installed at boot, every boot, each login, and first login:

	USE_PKGBUILD=1
	include /usr/local/share/luggage/luggage.make
	TITLE=outset_resources_sample
	REVERSE_DOMAIN=com.github.outset
	PAYLOAD= \
			pack-usr-local-outset-boot-once-sample_pkg.dmg \
			pack-usr-local-outset-boot-once-sample_pkg.pkg \
			pack-usr-local-outset-boot-once-sample_script_firstboot.py \
			pack-usr-local-outset-boot-every-sample_script_every.py \
			pack-usr-local-outset-login-every-sample_script_every.py \
			pack-usr-local-outset-login-once-sample_script_once.py \
			pack-usr-local-outset-on-demand-sample_script_on-demand.py

Credits
-------
This script was an excuse for me to learn more about python. I learn best when I can pull apart existing scripts. As such, this script is heavily based on the great work by [Nate Walck](https://github.com/natewalck/Scripts/blob/master/scriptRunner.py), [Allister Banks](https://gist.github.com/arubdesu/8271ba29ac5aff8f982c), [Rich Trouton](https://github.com/rtrouton/First-Boot-Package-Install), [Graham Gilbert](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/first-boot-pkg/blob/master/Resources/first-boot), and [Greg Neagle](https://github.com/munki/munki/blob/master/code/client/managedsoftwareupdate#L87).

Outset uses [FoundationPlist](https://github.com/munki/munki/blob/master/code/client/munkilib/FoundationPlist.py), a library to work with binary plists written by Greg Neagle as part of his [Munki](https://github.com/munki) project.
