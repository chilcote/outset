Outset
======

> NOTE: This instance of Outset is decommissioned and you should start using the Swift-based [Outset 4.0 available on the macadmins repo](https://github.com/macadmins/outset).

Outset is a script which automatically processes packages, profiles, and scripts during the boot sequence, user logins, or on demand.

Requirements
------------
+ macOS 10.15+
+ python 3.7+

If you need to support 10.14 or lower, stick with the 2.x version.

python3 can be installed from one of these sources:
- [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [MacAdmins](https://github.com/macadmins/python)
- [Munki](https://github.com/munki/munki)

If none of these are on disk, then fall back to Apple's system python3, which can be installed via the Command Line Tools.

Outset no longer supports python 2, which was [sunsetted on Jan 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). If you choose to continue to use python 2, you'll want to create the symlink via other means, with something like:

`/bin/ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/local/outset/python3`

Usage
-----

	usage: outset [-h]
				(--boot | --login | --login-privileged | --on-demand | --login-every | --login-once | --cleanup | --version | --add-ignored-user username | --remove-ignored-user username | --add-override scripts | --remove-override scripts)

This script was an excuse for me to try to learn python. I learn best when I can pull apart existing scripts. As such, this script is heavily based on the great work by [Nate Walck](https://github.com/natewalck/Scripts/blob/master/scriptRunner.py), [Allister Banks](https://gist.github.com/arubdesu/8271ba29ac5aff8f982c), [Rich Trouton](https://github.com/rtrouton/First-Boot-Package-Install), [Graham Gilbert](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/first-boot-pkg/blob/master/Resources/first-boot), and [Greg Neagle](https://github.com/munki/munki/blob/master/code/client/managedsoftwareupdate#L87).

Special thanks to @homebysix for working on the python3 compatibility release.
